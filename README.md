# Geritch Hotel

> The hotel website was built using React, a JavaScript library that allowed me to create a highly modular and reusable codebase. I used a number of React-specific tools and libraries, including React Router, Redux, and Styled Components, and leveraged server-side rendering using Next.js for improved performance and SEO. Our site is highly responsive and optimized for different screen sizes, thanks to the use of responsive design techniques such as media queries and Flexbox. We also employed a number of back-end technologies, including Node.js and Firebase, to support our site's functionality. Overall, our use of cutting-edge web technologies and best practices has enabled us to create a high-performance, scalable, and user-friendly hotel website.
